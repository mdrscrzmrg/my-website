Hello! This are my furbabies. I would like to introduce my furbaby1 she is a
Shih Tzu breed, her name is Kesha and she's 9 years old. My furbaby2 he is a 
Shih Tzu breed, his name is Kyzer, but he died last 2015. My furbaby3 she is a
Siamese Cat, her name is Mochi, but she died last March 2022. I would like to 
share a short story about Mochi. She's my first ever cat because before I met
her I hate cats, but when my uncle gave Mochi to me I fell in love with her and 
it's still hurts because she's gone. My furbaby4 her name is Mucha and like Mochi
she is a Siamese, she's Mochi's niece and she is 5 months old. My furbaby5
his name is Loki, he is half Puspin and half British Short Hair he is 2 months old.
